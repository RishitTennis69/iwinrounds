## Customization

### AI Service Integration

To use a real AI service instead of the mock service, modify `src/utils/aiService.ts`:

```typescript
// Replace mock implementation with OpenAI, Claude, or other AI service
static async summarizeSpeech(transcript: string) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/analyze-speech', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ transcript })
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

### Speech Recognition

The application uses the Web Speech API. For better accuracy, consider integrating with:
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
- Azure Speech Services
- Amazon Transcribe

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome 66+
- ‚úÖ Edge 79+
- ‚úÖ Safari 14.1+
- ‚ùå Firefox (limited Web Speech API support)
